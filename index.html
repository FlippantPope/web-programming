            <p class="block">Hello, my name is Jon Middleton. I am originally from Florida and currently live in Northern California. Growing up, 
                computers always piqued my interest. I remember being introduced to them at a young age when dad brought home a Gateway desktop, 
                where most applications were run from 2.5-inch floppy disks instead of stored on the local hard drive. That is when I learned 
                about video games.</p>
            <p class="block">Fast forward almost 30 years, not only has my life changed significantly but so has the video game industry. Now the video game 
                industry is worth $90 billion, according to <cite>statista.com <a href="#cite-one">[1]</a></cite>, and has made its way into almost every living room, including my own. 
                Over the years, the type of video games I play have varied from first-person shooters to farming simulators. How I play video games 
                has also varied. For a long time, I played on console platforms such as Xbox or PlayStation. But more recently I have gone back to 
                my roots and have been focusing on PC gaming.</p>
            <div class="block">
                <p>Some web sites that I use to keep up to date are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Steam</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">YouTube</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">MetaCritic</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="block">In the future, this website will be iterated on with features and content that will focus on providing information and updates for 
                upcoming video game releases. A short how-to guide will be created to showcase the steps needed to get updates for video games on 
                the Steam storefront. Also, dedicated pages will be created to showcase a few video games that are already more popular.</p>
