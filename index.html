        <p>Hello, my name is Jon Middleton. I am originally from Florida and currently live in Northern California. Growing up, 
            computers always piqued my interest. I remember being introduced to them at a young age when dad brought home a Gateway desktop, 
            where most applications were run from 2.5-inch floppy disks instead of stored on the local hard drive. That is when I learned 
            about video games.</p>
        <p>Fast forward almost 30 years, not only has my life changed significantly but so has the video game industry. Now the video game 
            industry is worth $90 billion, according to <cite>statista.com <a href="#cite-one">[1]</a></cite>, and has made its way into almost every living room, including my own. 
            Over the years, the type of video games I play have varied from first-person shooters to farming simulators. How I play video games 
            has also varied. For a long time, I played on console platforms such as Xbox or PlayStation. But more recently I have gone back to 
            my roots and have been focusing on PC gaming.</p>
        <p>In the future, this website will be iterated on with features and content that will focus on providing information and updates for 
            upcoming video game releases. A short how-to guide will be created to showcase the steps needed to get updates for video games on 
            the Steam storefront. Also, dedicated pages will be created to showcase a few video games that are already more popular.</p>
